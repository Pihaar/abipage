##Development
You need to have nodejs and ruby being installed on your PC to develop this project.
Before you start to develop it, please run the init_tools.bat (or call the following commands
on your console: `npm install -g less coffee-script uglify-js cssmin`
and ``em install watchr colored`). Then run the watchr.rb while you edit the css, less, js or coffee files,
as the watchr.rb script automatically compiles and minimizes the files.
